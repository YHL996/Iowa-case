Project Title: A Chatbot for Summarizing Employee Reviews
  
Objectives: In the Iowa Business Analytics Case Competition, our team aimed to help a leading aluminum packaging company improve its human resources management.

Methodology: Our team built an LLM-based chatbot using the Flask framework to provide the service through a webpage. We scraped employee reviews from Indeed to construct a dataset for the chatbot to refer to and used an open-source model, Mixtral 8x7b, to answer users' questions based on the dataset. Users can ask the chatbot any questions regarding the employee reviews, such as "How do the employees feel about working in the company?" and "What are the cons of working in this company?". 
   
Results: Utilizing the LLM, the chatbot can efficiently summarize valuable information from employee reviews. HR managers can save time by simply using this chatbot to understand the latest feedback from the Internet. Therefore, corresponding action plans can be rolled out to improve the company's HR management.
